Detailed action plan for the inference flow

restore: lambda
colorize: lambda
save: lambda

1. Image is uploaded to S3
2. EventBridge triggers restore with the image as payload
3. restore extracts the scale from the image payload 
4. restore sends the image to replicate with the scale specified
5. Once restore gets back a restored image:
  If colorization is needed restore triggers "image restored" and then sends the restored image as payload.
  Otherwise restore triggers 'process complete' EventBridge
6. EventBridge triggers colorize with the restored image as payload
7. colorize sends the image to replicate and once the image is colorized
  it sends an a 'process finished' event with colorized image as payload
8. EventBridge triggers save
9. save adds the processed image to S3
10. Finally the frontend can get the processed image
